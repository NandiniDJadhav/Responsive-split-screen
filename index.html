                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is widely used for developing applications across various platforms, including web, mobile, and enterprise software. One of Java's key features is its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability, which allows programs written in Java to run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, making code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain. It includes a rich set of libraries, strong memory management, multithreading capabilities, and built-in security features. Java is commonly used in Android app development, enterprise-level applications, cloud computing, and big data technologies. Due to its scalability, portability, and vast community support, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

                Java programming is a powerful and versatile approach to software development, widely recognized for its object-oriented principles and platform independence. Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle, Java allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere with the help of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It supports essential programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it ideal for building scalable and maintainable applications. Java is extensively used in web development, enterprise applications, mobile app development (especially Android), cloud computing, and big data processing. With a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, and strong community support, Java remains a top choice for developers in building reliable and efficient software solutions.
